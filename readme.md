# E-Commerce Analysis

## Project Structure
The analysis will be separated into 3 files which will tackle each questions above independently. This is just for readability purposes. These files are:
1. ``case_ordered_products.ipynb``
2. ``case_product_reviews.ipynb``
3. ``case_seller_sold_product.ipynb``

The purpose of other files:
1 The ``sql_functions.py`` file is used to store any function related to SQL configurtion or connection
2 The ``sql_queries.py`` file is used to store all the SQL queries necessary for this project

These functions would be called on each analysis or case file.
